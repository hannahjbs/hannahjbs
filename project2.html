				<h2>Shape Constrained Inference in Toxicology </h2>
			</header>

			<p><u><strong>Background</strong></u></p>
		<p>
             Chemicals must be screened for potential impact to human health, and quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) tests thousands of chemicals at once.  Statistical analysis must be done to decide which chemicals pose a risk.
             Most of the data takes the same shape of a sigmoidal “dose-response curve”, for example:

				, which is well characterized with a four parameter logistic equation. However, some chemicals are non-sigmoidal:

				</a>
			</div>

	          <p>
             I used a semi-parametric spline based statistical method by Dr. Qing Yin <a href="https://github.com/qy2166/SRMERS">(github code here)</a> to filter the dataset into different shape groups. Then, I could see how logistic regression would perform on these datasets.
			  </p>

			<p><u><strong>Methods</strong></u></p>

          <p>
             I sorted a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05664">~10,000 chemical dataset </a> by shape and compared model sums of squared error (SSE) with logistic regression.
          <p>
             Shape determination was done by fitting data to four shape kernels (“convex”, “concave”, “increasing” and “decreasing”). Confidence intervals for deciding shape were bootstrapped, which was computationally intensive. Therefore, I implemented adaptive bootstrapping to speed up processing time, which improved speed by 25%.
          </p>



			<p><u><strong>Results</strong></u></p>

          <p>
             The dataset contained many different shapes, 8% of which were not sigmoidal. Logistic regression performed poorly for these shapes.
          </p>

			<p>
				As expected for an estrogen receptor dataset, the increasing response shaped chemicals were heavily associated with Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1). Less expectedly, some “concave” chemicals were also associated with ESR1.

          <p>
             Further research should be done on scientific relevance of these non-sigmoidal datasets.
			  </p>

			<p>
			  Filtering qHTS datasets by shape first may be a good addition to statistical workflows, allowing logistic regression to be used on the most appropriate data.

          </p>
